            practices, and have seeded their way into many applications across
            the world.MongoDB also offers a free, open-source version, which is
            an excellent option for teams on a budget who can stand up a
            database server on-premises or in the cloud.

          <p className="text-justify">
            JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
            information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT
            contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
            signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
            cannot be altered after the token is issued.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-medium p-2 underline">How dose JWT work?</h2>
          <p className="text-justify">
            JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of
            claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties.
            What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example,
            a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for,
            or what permissions the client has been granted. <br /> A JWT is a
            string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized
            using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact
            serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.
